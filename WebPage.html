            <h3>Batman Begins</h3>
            <p>
              Everybody knows Batman’s origin story. The murder of Bruce Wayne’s
              parents by a mugger named Joe Chill is a central part of the Batman
              mythos and explains his motivations for becoming a masked vigilante. The
              story of his parents’ death, however, wasn’t created until Detective
              Comics #33, nearly a year after the first Batman story hit the shelves.
            </p>
            <h3>Like Bat-Father, Like Bat-Son</h3>
            <p>
              Bruce Wayne’s father, Thomas Wayne, was a medical doctor and heir to the
              Wayne Enterprises fortune. It’s been implied in a number of stories that
              Thomas Wayne was himself a masked vigilante.
            </p>
            <h3>Wayne Enterprises</h3>
            <p>
              Wayne Enterprises is pretty large as far as fictional corporations go.
              Valued at $31.3 billion, Wayne Enterprises has many, many subdivisions.
              There is Wayne Medical, Wayne Biotech, Wayne Automotive, Wayne Foods—it
              has a presence in virtually every industry, and the dollar bills to show
              for it.
            </p>
            <h3>Holy Homophobia, Batman!</h3>
            <p>
              Bruce Wayne’s habit of adopting and forming close relationships with
              teenage boys has led some people to suggest Batman is gay. A
              not-entirely-tolerant accusation to that effect formed the basis of
              Seduction of the Innocent, a 1954 book written by a psychiatrist that
              attacked comic books. It eventually led to the creation of the Comics
              Code Authority.
